            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Filip.
                I majored in Molecular Biotechnology at Jagiellonian University. Despite
                my studies being focused on wet-lab and my extensive experience in laboratory work, my interests are
                primarily focused on biological data analysis. Today, I work as an embedded bioinformatician
                at Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie National Research Center of Oncology. I use machine learning techniques,
                statistical methods and automation pipelines to effectively extract information from large data sets,
                visualize and clearly describe the results I have obtained.
            </p>
            <h2>Navigate through my work</h2>
            <p>
                If you wish to learn more about work I do, please visit my
                <a href="/portfolio" target="_blank">portfolio</a> page. You can find my Jupyter notebooks and R
                markdown files there serving as analysis reports. These are both in polish and english. You may also
                visit my <a href="https://github.com/f1lem0n" target="_blank">github</a>
                profile to see how I manage my projects. I also post data analysis related stories on my
                <a href="https://medium.com/@filem0n1" target="_blank">medium</a> blog, although it does not happen very
                often. If you like these stories don't forget to follow me there and give me a clap or some
                constructive feedback!
            </p>
            <h2>What do I use?</h2>
            <p>
                As far as technology goes I mainly use Python and R for data analysis, modelling and visualization.
                However I am familiar with other languages and frameworks which are (almost fully) listed down below.
            </p>
            Data analysis:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Python</b> + numpy + pandas + sklearn + tensorflow + plotly</li>
                <li><b>R</b> + dplyr + ggplot2 + limma + edgeR</li>
                <li>Bash</li>
            </ul>

            Web development:

                <li><b>Python</b> + streamlit</li>
            </ul>

            Database management:
            <ul>
                <li>SQL</li>
