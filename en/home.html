                I offer a full scope of data analysis services, from data cleaning, through exploratory analysis,
                modelling, to visualization and reporting. I am also open to any other data-related projects.
                If you are a student or a researcher I can also help you design your experiment better based on
                certain statistical indicators e.g. power analysis. Send me an
                <a href="mailto:hajdylaf@gmail.com">e-mail</a> to schedule a consultation.

                    <h2>Data cleaning and preprocessing</h2>
                    <p>
                        I would argue that it is the most important aspect of any analysis. It also
                        takes the most time and effort as it is a very tedious process and has to
                        be adjusted to the data at hand. It has to be done properly and with attention
                        to details to ensure that the results of the analysis are valid and reliable.
                        I offer a full scope of data cleaning services, from simple data validation
                        to complex data imputation.

                    <h2>Analysis and modelling</h2>
                    <p>
                        If given a dataset with rather a small number of features, one can perform
                        a classic statistical analysis to gain insight into the phenomena which the
                        data represents. On the other hand, if the dataset is large and complex, one
                        can use machine learning or deep learning methods to extract information from it.
                        I offer both types of analysis and modelling services based on the data you provide.

                    <p>
                        The results of any analysis are only as good as the way they are presented.
                        What would be the point of a great analysis if no one can understand it?
                        I offer a full scope of visualization and reporting services, from simple
                        plots and tables to interactive dashboards and reports in any of the following formats:
                        PDF, HTML, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown. I can also help you
                        prepare a presentation of your results for a conference or a meeting.
